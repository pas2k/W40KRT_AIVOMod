## Acknowledgements

This mod would not be possible without massive work put into its foundation, SpeechMod by Osmodium.

## Known issues for the mod:

 - Despite my best efforts, might conflict with original SpeechMod

## How to install the mod 📝
 - Download the W40KRT_AIVOMod mod file and unzip.
 - Please note that the game comes with its own built in Unity Mod Manager so you do not need to install another one.
 - Navigate to %userprofile%\AppData\LocalLow\Owlcat Games\Warhammer 40000 Rogue Trader\UnityModManager\
 - Copy the W40KRT_AIVOMod folder into the UnityModManager folder
 - Copy your selected voice pack (.bnk file) into W40KRT_AIVOMod\soundbanks
 - Launch Warhammer 40K: Rogue Trader, you may need to hit ctrl+F10 to see the mod manager window.
 - On updating, remove .dll.\*.cache from mod directory to be sure you're using the latest version


## Available voiceover packs

### (Recommended) Common Voice-derived voicepack

Voices designed from scratch to imitate original characters, but without using the original voiceover in the process. No OwlCat games used for voice cloning, instead Charvogen and my own voice was used to convey the character.
Charvogen source is provided, feel free to experiment and contribute better voices, as long as you didn't use samples from the original game to do it.

### (Outdated) Voice-cloned characters from Rogue Trader

Doesn't contain fixes or DLCs starting with Infinite Museion. Limited roster, limited genders, but most faithful representation to the game. Might have conflict of interests with voice actors, so might be taken down.

## Known issues for the voiceover packs
 - Shorter cues might have artifacts/repeats
 - The "computer diagogues" are funky
 - The pronounciation of some 40k-specific terms can be wrong/uneven
 - Due to difficulty of statically resolving dialogues, some voices might be wrong
 - Voices have a limited roster of emotions/archetypes
 - Barks sometimes overlap and are poorly attenuated by the the camera position
 - Since SoundBanksInfo.xml is not available for RT, the topology used is "Whatever works" instead of maybe better buses/mixers
 - Voice packs are only made for male Rogue Trader
