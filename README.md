By [pas2k](https://github.com/pas2k)
Based on [SpeechMod](https://github.com/Osmodium/W40KRogueTraderSpeechMod) by [Osmodium](https://github.com/Osmodium)

## Acknowledgements

This mod would not be possible without massive work put into its foundation, SpeechMod by Osmodium.

## Known issues for the mod:

 - Conflicts with original SpeechMod

## Known issues for the voiceover pack
 - Shorter cues might have artifacts/repeats
 - The "computer diagogues" are funky
 - The pronounciation of some 40k-specific terms can be wrong/uneven
 - Due to difficulty of statically resolving dialogues, some voices might be wrong
 - Voices have a limited roster of emotions/archetypes/voice actors
 - Barks sometimes overlap and are poorly filtered by the the camera position
 - Since SoundBanksInfo.xml is not available for RT, the topology used is "Whatever works" instead of maybe better buses/mixers
